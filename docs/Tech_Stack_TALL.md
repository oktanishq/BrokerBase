# 📄 TECHNOLOGY STACK: The Dealer Vault Architecture

**Project:** BrokerBase - Dealer Inventory Management System
**Architecture:** TALL Stack (Tailwind, Alpine, Laravel, Livewire)
**Target Server:** Apache (XAMPP / cPanel / Shared Hosting)

---

# **1. Executive Summary**

This document outlines the technology stack for the **Dealer Vault**, the core "E-commerce for Properties" engine where dealers manage their inventory.

To meet the requirement of **"Already designed HTML pages"** and **"Apache Server Compatibility"**, we are adopting the **TALL Stack**. This allows us to paste existing HTML directly into the backend while adding "App-like" interactivity (instant page swaps, image previews) without needing a complex separate React frontend.

---

# **2. The TALL Stack Overview**

## **2.1 Frontend (The View Layer)**

### **HTML + Blade Templates**
*   **Role:** The skeleton of the application.
*   **Usage:** We use Laravel's Blade engine to render the HTML. This allows us to break the UI into reusable chunks (e.g., `<x-sidebar />`, `<x-property-card />`) so we can **edit things separately**.

### **Tailwind CSS**
*   **Role:** Styling and Design.
*   **Usage:** Utility-first CSS. Since you already have the designs, we simply drop the Tailwind classes into the Blade files.

### **Alpine.js**
*   **Role:** Micro-interactions (The "JavaScript" replacement).
*   **Usage:** Handles small UI tasks like toggling the "Mobile Menu", opening "Modals", or the "Image Carousel" swipe action directly in the browser.

## **2.2 The "Magic" Layer (Connecting Front & Back)**

### **Laravel Livewire**
*   **Role:** Dynamic Behavior & State Management.
*   **Why:** It allows us to write "Frontend" code using **PHP**.
*   **The "App-Like" Feel:** We use `wire:navigate` on links. This tells the browser *not* to reload the page, but to fetch the new HTML in the background and swap it instantly.
*   **Modular Editing:** Every feature (e.g., "Add Property Wizard") is its own component with its own PHP file and HTML file.

## **2.3 Backend (The Logic Layer)**

### **Laravel 11 (PHP)**
*   **Role:** The Core Engine.
*   **Responsibilities:**
    *   Routing (URL management).
    *   Database Queries (PostgreSQL).
    *   Image Processing (Watermarking).
    *   Security (Authentication).

### **PostgreSQL**
*   **Role:** The Database.
*   **Usage:** Stores property data, dealer profiles, and location coordinates (PostGIS).

# **3. Modular Folder Structure**

To achieve your goal of **"Editing things separately"**, we organize the code by **Feature**, not just by file type.

```text
/app/Livewire
    /Properties
        ├── CreateProperty.php      (Logic: Validation, Saving)
        ├── EditProperty.php        (Logic: Updating)
        └── ListProperties.php      (Logic: Filtering, Searching)
    /Dealer
        ├── ProfileSettings.php
        └── BrandingSetup.php

/resources/views/livewire
    /properties
        ├── create-property.blade.php  (HTML: The Wizard Form)
        ├── edit-property.blade.php    (HTML: The Edit Form)
        └── list-properties.blade.php  (HTML: The Grid View)
```

**Benefit:** If you need to change how the "Add Property" form looks, you only touch `create-property.blade.php`. If you need to change how it *saves*, you touch `CreateProperty.php`.

# **4. System Architecture**

Unlike the React architecture which requires two servers (Frontend + Backend), this architecture runs as a **Single Application** on Apache.

          └───────────────────────┘

# **5. Key Features Implementation**

## **5.1 The "Add Property" Wizard (Ecommerce Style)**
Instead of a complex React State machine, we use a **Livewire Multi-Step Component**.

*   **State:** `$step` (1, 2, 3, 4).
*   **Action:** When user clicks "Next", Livewire validates the current inputs and increments `$step`.
*   **UI:** The HTML updates instantly to show the next form section.

## **5.2 Image Upload & Watermarking**
*   **Frontend:** Livewire has a built-in `WithFileUploads` trait.
    *   *Feature:* Shows a "Temporary Preview" of the image immediately after dropping it, before it even uploads fully.
*   **Backend:** Laravel intercepts the upload, applies the **Dealer Logo Watermark** using `Intervention Image`, and saves it to storage.

## **5.3 The "Vault" (Inventory Management)**
*   **Search/Filter:** As the user types in the search bar, Livewire re-queries the database and updates the table rows *without* refreshing the page.

# **6. Deployment Strategy (Shared Hosting - cPanel)**

This stack is optimized for shared hosting environments with Apache+PHP. The recommended approach uses subdomains to avoid document root limitations.

### **6.1 Local Preparation**
Build assets on your local machine:
```bash
npm run build
```
*This compiles your Tailwind CSS and Alpine JS into standard `.css` and `.js` files.*

### **6.2 Shared Hosting Deployment Steps**

#### **Step 1: Create Subdomain**
- In your hosting panel (cPanel), create a new subdomain (e.g., `app.yourdomain.com`)
- Set the document root to `public_html/public`
- This bypasses the shared hosting limitation of not being able to change document roots

#### **Step 2: Upload Files**
Upload the following structure to your server:
```
public_html/
├── app/
├── config/
├── routes/
├── resources/
├── vendor/        (Will be created by composer)
└── ...
└── public/            (Web root for subdomain)
    ├── index.php      (Copy from laravel/public/)
    ├── .htaccess      (Copy from laravel/public/)
    └── build/         (Copy from laravel/public/build/)
```

#### **Step 3: Install Dependencies**
Run this command in your hosting terminal/file manager:
```bash
cd public_html
composer install --optimize-autoloader --no-dev
```
*If composer install doesn't work on server, upload the `vendor` folder from your local setup.*

```

### **6.3 Production Optimization**
- Set `APP_ENV=production` in `.env`
- Run `php artisan config:cache` for better performance
- Set proper file permissions (755 for directories, 644 for files)

*No Node.js server required. No separate API configuration. No CORS issues.*

# **7. Why This Fits Your Request**

| Requirement | Solution |
| :--- | :--- |
| **"Pages already designed in HTML"** | We paste that HTML directly into Blade files. No conversion to JSX required. |
| **"Apache Server"** | Laravel runs natively on Apache. No special proxy setup needed. |
| **"Edit things separately"** | Livewire components separate the UI (Blade) from the Logic (PHP Class). |
| **"Ecommerce Store Feel"** | Livewire handles the dynamic "Cart/Inventory" updates instantly. |
| **"Running Backend"** | Laravel handles all the heavy lifting (Auth, DB, Security). |

---

# **8. Future Proofing**

*   **PWA:** We can install `laravel-pwa` to make this installable on mobile phones.
*   **API:** If you build a native mobile app later, Laravel can still serve JSON APIs alongside this web interface.

# **9. Project Initialization Guide**

### **9.1 Prerequisites**
*   **PHP & Composer** (For Backend)
*   **Node.js & NPM** (For Frontend Build)

### **9.2 Installation Commands**

**1. Install Laravel**
```bash
composer create-project laravel/laravel 
cd brokerbase
```

**2. Install Livewire**
```bash
composer require livewire/livewire
```

**3. Install Tailwind & Alpine**
```bash
npm install
npm install -D tailwindcss@&v3.4.0
npm install postcss autoprefixer
npx tailwindcss init -p
npm install alpinejs
```

**4. Final Build**
When deploying to Apache, run:
```bash
npm run build
```
*This generates the `public/build` folder containing the optimized CSS and JS.*
